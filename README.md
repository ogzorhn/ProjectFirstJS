# TestSuitePlus

In the pursuit of establishing a robust testing framework, I have not only focused on the basic functionalities but also incorporated advanced testing criteria to enhance the overall quality of the test scenarios. For user login, the .js test cases not only validate successful login scenarios but also meticulously evaluate edge cases, such as invalid usernames or passwords, to ensure a comprehensive examination of system resilience.

In terms of arithmetic operations, the test cases extend beyond typical scenarios by accounting for various operand types, including integers, decimals, and edge cases like division by zero. This meticulous approach ensures that the API not only handles standard inputs but also gracefully manages unexpected situations, contributing to the system's reliability.

Moreover, for the sum calculation endpoint, the .js test cases assess the accuracy of results for a diverse set of inputs, covering both small and large values of 'n.' This breadth in testing criteria establishes a robust foundation, addressing potential performance and scalability concerns.

By incorporating these detailed and diverse testing criteria, the test scenarios not only validate the immediate functionality but also contribute significantly to the overall resilience, security, and performance of the API endpoints, ensuring a high standard of quality in the development process.
